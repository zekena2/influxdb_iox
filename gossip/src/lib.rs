//! A simple gossip & broadcast primitive for best-effort metadata distribution
//! between IOx nodes.
//!
//! # Peers
//!
//! Peers are uniquely identified by their self-reported "identity" UUID. A
//! unique UUID is generated for each gossip instance, ensuring the identity
//! changes across restarts of the underlying node.
//!
//! An identity is associated with an immutable socket address used for peer
//! communication.
//!
//! # Topics
//!
//! The gossip system implements a topic / interest based, send-side filter to
//! prevent node A sending frames to node B that it doesn't care about - this
//! helps reduce traffic and CPU / processing on both nodes.
//!
//! During peer exchange, a node advertises the set of peers it is (and other
//! peers are) interested in, and messages for a given topic are dispatched only
//! to interested nodes.
//!
//! Topics are immutable for the lifetime of a gossip instance, and control
//! frames are exempt from topic filtering and are always exchanged between all
//! peers.
//!
//! # Transport
//!
//! Prefer small payloads where possible, and expect loss of some messages -
//! this primitive provides *best effort* delivery.
//!
//! This implementation sends unicast UDP frames between peers, with support for
//! both control frames & user payloads. The maximum UDP message size is 65,507
//! bytes ([`MAX_USER_PAYLOAD_BYTES`] for application-level payloads), but a
//! packet this large is fragmented into smaller (at most MTU-sized) packets and
//! is at greater risk of being dropped due to a lost fragment.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! Messages exchanged between peers are unauthenticated and connectionless -
//! it's trivial to forge a message appearing to come from a different peer, or
//! include malicious payloads.
//!
//! The security model of this implementation expects the peers to be running in
//! a trusted environment, secure from malicious users.
//!
//! # Peer Exchange
//!
//! When a gossip instance is initialised, it advertises itself to the set of
//! user-provided "seed" peers - other gossip instances with fixed, known
//! addresses. The peer then bootstraps the peer list from these seed peers.
//!
//! Peers are discovered through PONG messages from peers, which contain the
//! list of peers the sender has successfully communicated with.
//!
//! On receipt of a PONG frame, a node will send PING frames to all newly
//! discovered peers without adding the peer to its local peer list. Once the
//! discovered peer responds with a PONG, the peer is added to the peer list.
//! This acts as a liveness check, ensuring a node only adds peers it can
//! communicate with to its peer list.
//!

//! ```
//!
//! The above illustrates this process when the "local" node joins:
//!
//!   1. Send PING messages to all configured seeds
//!   2. Receive a PONG response containing the list of all known peers
//!   3. Send PING frames to all discovered peers - do not add to peer list
//!   4. Receive PONG frames from discovered peers - add to peer list
//!
//! The peer addresses sent during PEX rounds contain the advertised peer
//! identity and the socket address the PONG sender discovered.
//!
//! # Dead Peer Removal
//!
//! All peers are periodically sent a PING frame, and a per-peer counter is
//! incremented. If a message of any sort is received (including the PONG
//! response to the soliciting PING), the peer's counter is reset to 0.
//!
//! Once a peer's counter reaches [`MAX_PING_UNACKED`], indicating a number of
//! PINGs have been sent without receiving any response, the peer is removed
//! from the node's peer list.
//!
//! Dead peers age out of the cluster once all nodes perform the above routine.
//! If a peer dies, it is still sent in PONG messages as part of PEX until it is
//! removed from the sender's peer list, but the receiver of the PONG will not
//! add it to the node's peer list unless it successfully commutates, ensuring
//! dead peers are not propagated.
//!
//! Ageing out dead peers is strictly an optimisation (and not for correctness).
//! A dead peer consumes a tiny amount of RAM, but also will have frames
//! dispatched to it - over time, as the number of dead peers accumulates, this
//! would cause the number of UDP frames sent per broadcast to increase,
//! needlessly increasing gossip traffic.
//!
//! This process is heavily biased towards reliability/deliverability and is too
//! slow for use as a general peer health check.
