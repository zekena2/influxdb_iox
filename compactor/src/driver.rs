/// Main function to compact files of a single partition.
///
/// Input: any files in the partitions (L0s, L1s, L2s)
/// Output:
/// 1. No overlapped  L0 files
/// 2. Up to N non-overlapped L1 and L2 files,  subject to  the total size of the files.
///
/// N: config max_number_of_files
///
/// Note that since individual files also have a maximum size limit, the
/// actual number of files can be more than  N.  Also since the Parquet format
/// features high and variable compression (page splits, RLE, zstd compression),
/// splits are based on estimated output file sizes which may deviate from actual file sizes
///
/// Algorithms
///
/// GENERAL IDEA OF THE CODE: DIVIDE & CONQUER  (we have not used all of its power yet)
///
/// The files are split into non-time-overlaped branches, each is compacted in parallel.
/// The output of each branch is then combined and re-branch in next round until
/// they should not be compacted based on defined stop conditions.
///
/// Example: Partition has 7 files: f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7
///  Input: shown by their time range
///          |--f1--|               |----f3----|  |-f4-||-f5-||-f7-|
///               |------f2----------|                   |--f6--|
///
/// - Round 1: Assuming 7 files are split into 2 branches:
///  . Branch 1: has 3 files: f1, f2, f3
///  . Branch 2: has 4 files: f4, f5, f6, f7
///          |<------- Branch 1 -------------->|  |<-- Branch 2 -->|
///          |--f1--|               |----f3----|  |-f4-||-f5-||-f7-|
///               |------f2----------|                   |--f6--|
///
///    Output: 3 files f8, f9, f10
///          |<------- Branch 1 -------------->|  |<-- Branch 2--->|
///          |---------f8---------------|--f9--|  |-----f10--------|
///
/// - Round 2: 3 files f8, f9, f10 are in one branch and compacted into 2 files
///    Output: two files f11, f12
///          |-------------------f11---------------------|---f12---|
///
/// - Stop condition meets and the final output is f11 & F12
///
/// The high level flow is:
///
///   . Mutiple rounds, each round process mutltiple branches. Each branch includes at most 200 files
///   . Each branch will compact files lowest level (aka start-level) into its next level (aka target-level), either:
///      - Compact many L0s into fewer and larger L0s. Start-level = target-level = 0
///      - Compact many L1s into fewer and larger L1s. Start-level = target-level = 1
///      - Compact (L0s & L1s) to L1s if there are L0s. Start-level = 0, target-level = 1
///      - Compact (L1s & L2s) to L2s if no L0s. Start-level = 1, target-level = 2
///      - Split L0s each of which overlaps with more than 1 L1s into many L0s, each overlaps with at most one L1 files
///      - Split L1s each of which overlaps with more than 1 L2s into many L1s, each overlaps with at most one L2 files
///   . Each branch does find non-overlaps and upgragde files to avoid unecessary recompacting.
///     The actually split files:
///      1. files_to_keep: do not compact these files because they are already higher than target level
///      2. files_to_upgrade: upgrade this initial-level files to target level because they are not overlap with
///          any target-level and initial-level files and large enough (> desired max size)
///      3. files_to_split_or_compact: this is either files to split or files to compact and will be handled accordingly

///
/// Example: 4 files: two L0s, two L1s and one L2
///  Input:
///                                      |-L0.1-||------L0.2-------|
///                  |-----L1.1-----||--L1.2--|
///     |----L2.1-----|
///
///  - Round 1: There are L0s, let compact L0s with L1s. But let split them first:
///    . files_higher_keep: L2.1 (higher leelve than targetlevel) and L1.1 (not overlapped wot any L0s)
///    . files_upgrade: L0.2
///    . files_compact: L0.1, L1.2
///    Output: 4 files
///                                               |------L1.4-------|
///                  |-----L1.1-----||-new L1.3 -|        ^
///     |----L2.1-----|                  ^               |
///                                      |        result of upgrading L0.2
///                            result of compacting L0.1, L1.2
///
///  - Round 2: Compact those 4 files
///    Output: two L2 files
///     |-----------------L2.2---------------------||-----L2.3------|
///
/// Note:
///   . If there are no L0s files in the partition, the first round can just compact L1s and L2s to L2s
